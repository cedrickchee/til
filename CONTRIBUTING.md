If you are interested in contributing your own TIL content, I encourage you to 
head on over to  to head on over to
[til-collective/til](https://github.com/til-collective/til) and make your [til-collective](https://github.com/til-collective/til-collective) and make your
submission there. As for this repo, I'd like to maintain it as my own personal 
learning journey.
