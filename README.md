# TIL (Today I Learned)

We constantly learn new things. This is a collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day. These are things that don't really warrant a full [blog](https://cedricchee.com) post. Some of these things I've picked up by [Learning In Public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/)â„¢.

For a steady stream of TILs, watch this repo or follow [@cedric_chee](https://twitter.com/cedric_chee) on Twitter.
